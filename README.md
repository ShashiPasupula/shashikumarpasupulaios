Steps to Set Up the App with Android Studio & npm
1. Clone the GitHub Repository
Visit the repository at the following link:
GitHub Repository Link
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shashikumarpasupula/shashikumarios.git
2. Install Prerequisites
a. Android Studio (For Android-specific code):

Download and install Android Studio if you haven't already.
Set up Android SDK and other necessary components when prompted.
b. Node.js & npm (For frontend or hybrid setup):

Install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager).
Verify your installation by running:
bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
3. Install Project Dependencies (npm)
Navigate to the Project Folder:

Go to the folder where you cloned the repository:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/shashikumarios
Install npm Dependencies:

Run the following command to install required packages:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
4. Open the Project in Android Studio (For Android Code)
Open Android Studio and select "Open an Existing Project".
Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and select the project folder.
Wait for Android Studio to sync and build the project. If necessary, it will prompt you to install any required SDK components.
5. Set Up the Android App in Android Studio
Connect an Android Device:

Connect a physical Android device via USB or set up an Android Emulator within Android Studio.
Enable USB debugging on your Android device.
Build and Run the Android App:

Once the project is loaded, click on the Run button (the green play icon) in Android Studio.
Select your connected device or emulator and let Android Studio build and deploy the app to the device.
6. Run the Frontend/Hybrid App (if applicable)
Start the Development Server:

In the terminal, navigate to the root of your project (if not already there):
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/shashikumarios
Run the following command to start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This should start a local server and open the app in the default browser or emulator.
Run the App on the Device/Emulator (for React Native or similar apps):

For React Native apps, you can run the app on your Android device/emulator using:
bash
Copy code
npx react-native run-android
This command will compile the app and launch it on your connected Android device or emulator.
7. Install APK (Alternative Option)
If you prefer using the APK directly, you can install the APK on the device:

Copy the APK (app-debug.apk) to your device and install it directly. If necessary, allow installations from unknown sources in the Android device settings.
Troubleshooting Tips
Build Failures: If you encounter any build issues, try cleaning and rebuilding the project:
bash
Copy code
./gradlew clean build
npm Errors: If there are missing or incompatible npm dependencies, you can try clearing the npm cache and reinstalling dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm cache clean --force
npm install
